/**
 * Intersection types
 */
/**
// allows us to combine multiple types together

// order of a customer
interface Order {
   id: string;
   amount: number;
   currency: string;
}

// for payment by card
interface Stripe {
   card: string;
   cvc: string;
}

// payment by PayPal
interface PayPal {
   email: string;
}

// an order either is payed by card or by PayPal.
// create intersection type of Order and Stripe by defining a type
// and using the '&'. It is equivalent to extending both interface
// with Order, but keeps code more modular
type CheckoutCard = Order & Stripe;
type CheckoutPayPal = Order & PayPal;

// doesn't need to be two pre-defined interfaces
type CheckoutAbc = Order & {name: string};


const order: Order = {
   id: 'xj28',
   amount: 100 ,
   currency: 'USD'
};

// you can create objects of the intersection type
const orderCard : CheckoutCard = {
   ...order,
   card: '1000 2000 3000 4000',
   cvc: '123'
};

const orderPayPal: CheckoutPayPal = {
   ...order,
   email: "abd@def.com"
